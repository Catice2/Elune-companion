# Elune

Elune is a cross-platform AI companion app built around six unique personas known as the Seers. Each Seer helps guide the user through life with tailored insight, emotional support, and task management.

This is the personal development prototype. It includes core logging, time-based interaction, and modular AI interfaces.

## Current Phase: Foundations & Local Memory

- Flutter scaffold
- Local SQLite memory per Seer
- Persona-based log views
- Central Hall UI placeholder

Future phases will expand features, support theming, and allow AI chat personality interactions.
