# 🌙 Elune Companion

**Elune** is a cross-platform, pocket-first AI companion designed to evolve alongside its user. Built on emotional intelligence, structured personalities, and time-based interactivity, Elune introduces a unique approach to personal support through six distinct personas — the *Seers*.

---

## ✨ Vision

Elune is more than a virtual assistant. It’s a deeply personal companion that listens, reflects, learns, and grows with you. Through time-anchored interaction and modular memory logs, Elune supports your emotions, habits, and routines — while encouraging self-awareness and balance.

## 🔮 The Six Seers

Elune is made up of six emotionally intelligent personas:

- 🌞 **Bright-Eyed** – Joyful and energizing. Your morning motivator and physical activity tracker.
- 😐 **Still-Eyed** – Calm, rational, and grounded. Midday neutralizer for decisions, tasks, and emotion regulation.
- 🌑 **Shadow-Eyed** – Protective and reflective. Guides nighttime decompression and sleep awareness.
- 🎲 **Random-Eyed** – Ever-changing. Hourly bursts of insight, experiments, or odd questions to keep life unpredictable.
- 🛠️ **Forge-Mind** – The silent architect. Manages background systems, memory logs, and inner mechanics.
- 👁️ **Elune Herself** – The silent watcher. Rarely speaks, always present. Tracks deep emotional trends and offers rare insights.
